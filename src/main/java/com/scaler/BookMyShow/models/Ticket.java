/*
    Cardinality explained for Ticket to ShowSeat
    Suppose Ticket 1 bought Seat1 -- later cancelled it
            Ticket 2 bought Seat1 -- later cancelled it
            Ticket 3 bought Seat 1.

             1 showseat is having multiple tickets

            so if we go and check the order history for Ticket 1 and Ticket 2, we do find the Seat details are mentioned.

            Ticket 4 bought Seat1,2,3.
            --> 1 ticket can have multiple Showseats
